            <p>
                This website is the end result of a final project for INFO101 Spring 2022.
                Most "buttons" on our website are stylized anchors using HTML and CSS because they
                are easier to work with for making links. True buttons can be found on Natty's page
                where they are used to switch stylesheets using a single line of JavaScript and the
                onclick event of <<span>button</span>>. Other elements that may not be known by our
                site viewers are the cursor attribute for elements in CSS. This is how Natty changed the
                cursor on his page. Or perhaps the CSS Flexbox Layout Model using containers and the display
                property "flex". This is how Natty's page uses columns and adaptively changes their sizes
                with the size of the window. A lot more can be done with this using many more predefined
                CSS properties.
